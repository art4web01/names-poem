holiday poem about people everybody knows</br>
</br>
Names We Say to Death to Santa Clause</br>
Girls play it safe so have a chaser there</br>
Jim is just well Jim on his chair</br>
</br>
For good ‘ol cheer</br>
How Mary Beth’s best toaster makes toast. How two?</br>
</br>
Bell with Tyler it is Ty of Thunder where</br>
Physics nerds do Shot Put. Hats down</br>
</br>
Knowin' mouth err. They are rhymes ain’it</br>
If I’m Droppin’ one. I’m a kneeling Elf</br>
</br>
Nature thyme is good to well me </br>
I fly what’s mine so it is she who bakes like a pro so no</br>
</br>
Blew the slow candles. Took my cake. Parcel went south</br>
See its eye roll. Molly got more moles</br>
</br>
Left righting I write wee wheel little</br>
With Dawn can’t unwrap one gum to spell a command</br>
</br>
We ask how high. Kat's opening the North Pole mail</br>
This can't command to eat a parcel, forever paying</br>
